# TeamForge

Purpose Statement:
The purpose of this software is to create a tailored social platform for CS 370 students to enhance team-building, resulting in stronger project outcomes. By leveraging a standard graph, composing of nodes and edges, the platform will serve as the hub for team member information. Restricting its use to this class will inform its design and allow for benefit from class feedback; our experiences will also guide its development.
